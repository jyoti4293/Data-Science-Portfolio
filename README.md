* ## Election Result Prediction Project
   [Source Code](https://github.com/jyoti4293/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Election%20Result%20Prediction)
#### Objective:-
You are hired by one of the leading news channels CNBE who wants to analyze recent elections. This survey was conducted on 1525 voters with 9 variables. You have to build a model, to predict which party a voter will vote for on the basis of the given information, to create an exit poll that will help in predicting overall win and seats covered by a particular party.

#### Detailed Content:-
##### A Data Ingestion
 -  Read the dataset. Do the descriptive statistics and do the null value condition check. Write an inference on it 
 -  Perform Univariate and Bivariate Analysis. Do exploratory data analysis. Check for Outliers
##### B Data Preparation
 -  Encode the data (having string values) for Modelling. Is Scaling necessary here or not? Data Split: Split the data into train and test (70:30). 
##### C Modeling
 -  Apply Logistic Regression
 -  Apply KNN Model and Na√Øve Bayes Model. Interpret the results
 -  Model Tuning, Bagging (Random Forest for Bagging), and Boosting
 -  Performance Metrics: Check the performance of Predictions on Train and Test sets using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
##### Inferences:
 -  Based on these predictions, what are the insights?

* ## Text Analysis Project
 [Source Code](https://github.com/jyoti4293/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Text%20Analysis)
#### Objective- 
Work on the inaugural corpora from the nltk in Python

#### Detailed Content-
  - Find the number of characters, words, and sentences for the mentioned documents.
  - Remove all the stopwords from all three speeches.
  - Which word occurs the most number of times in his inaugural address for each president? Mention the top three words. (after removing the stopwords)
  - Plot the word cloud of each of the speeches of the variable. (after removing the stopwords)
